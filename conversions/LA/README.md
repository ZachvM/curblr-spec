# Los Angeles parking meters and signs

This folder contains a large dataset of [Los Angeles' parking regulations, translated into CurbLR](/conversions/LA/LA_CurbLR.json). The feed contains data from 35,000 parking signs, many with multiple complex regulations. [Raw data](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/71c26db1ad614faab1047cc8c3686ece_28) was accessed through LA's open data portal, matched to the SharedStreets Referencing System, cleaned into a [CurbLR-ready CSV](/conversions/LA/prepped_data.csv), and [converted](/js) into CurbLR's JSON format.

These data and scripts were created using for a previous version of CurbLR (v 1.0.0) and are provided for example purposes only.
